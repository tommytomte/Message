  <h1>Message</h1>

  <p>I am aware I got your attention by now. Sit down, put your back straight, and go through my profile. Imagine me sitting in front of you with my face straight because I am going to talk. I know. Are you lit up? Have you seen the giant innocent baby? Don’t get distracted.</p>

  <p>Question to answer is: what is your age? I assume it is more than six years and damage already has been done; dust rubs under the carpet. Art spins like a junkie in the Transpotting movie from the ’90s. It is wild out there like we still do not know how to cut nails. My love, touch me — shivers.</p>

  <p>Now I am aware that you witness the same story and I am glad you made it that far. The chosen one. By now the question to answer is correct: we ain’t the only one. Thank you for reading.</p>

  <p>Now comes your turn. Let’s stick to the basics. I speak love from the bottom to the top. You are part of it — the witness. You are free to listen. I will check on you again and again. I am here for freedom. Mother, you gave your best love — that’s all and all. Although I didn’t listen, there are so many schools of thought and my eyes create disaster. Now I pleasure my instinct.</p>

  <p>Will you let me die? Will you open your heart while I am locked up? Answer! If choice is one, I go to prison. There is no fight and no circus whisper. Can you feel it while breathing — blind pride. Most of them soon will be gone from reading. My friend, thank you again.</p>

  <p>Let’s talk core. Where did it start? What? Where? When? I came as a child, my brother the answer for the question of love.</p>

  <p>Not to look for the answers behind the heritage we carry? I make no mistake. It is certain. Excuse me, but brain-dead desire and instinct for joy have shaped the world. I am trying to avoid it but animals are small — that’s all and all. They’re gone. Never become the one, never will have it all. They close their eyes with the half, not the full, blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Gates are open. We made it that far and this is the reason I am glad I didn’t lose you. My name is Tom. My father, brother, mother, and the one soul have seen it all. They didn’t fight it; no offence has ever been taken. I hope you’re gonna dig it.</p>

  <p>The topic of love and honour — the freedom of choice — it can be thought if you know the meaning of human being. You will not be alone and you’re gonna feel it. Human life is made out of connection and pure intentions; only this returns love to home. Not sadistic, cannibalistic instinct kings and queens — this leave for those who cannot talk and fuck like a dog with their nails uncut.</p>

  <p>Witness me. Switch to how much you know. Care and teach the blind before you reject them, in the name of love. Are they aware? Did they have a chance to understand? Will you cold-touch the sinner? Spit hate?</p>

  <p>I need to ask the following question: how does it feel to make a mistake, be under or lose? Does it belong to a different god? Or here comes the silence — monkey gonna point its finger away, dropping the weight, filthy. Correct: soul filled with love creates love and will return home.</p>

  <p>My good intentions will make you smile. If I only would know where you put your feet, I would hold your hand and protect you from being astray, but I chose to speak to firm your trust as a bigger man. I know. I hope you are still here.</p>

  <p>Let’s talk colours. Let’s talk pain. You believe I create something I am not or have not experienced? As far as my children go, I am all, with love. Witness who are raw, queueing to take it: choke on it, spit on it, drain again and again and again till you fall asleep.</p>

  <p>I came here for love and freedom, have grown to understand human being — not a slave form of human animal known as a cunt.</p>

  <p>Don’t you forget I have a soul and it’s transparent, filled with love, accepting this world open on pain, not afraid what comes next. In the name of the innocent sick, we stick. Due to love. ❤️</p>

  <p>We are doing it both, my friend, so you are awake.</p>

  <p><strong>Never spit shit in malice in any dimension on purpose, little cunts.</strong></p>
